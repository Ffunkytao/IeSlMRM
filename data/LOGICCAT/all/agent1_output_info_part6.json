No conversions needed.\n\n6. **Tables & Fields**:  \n   - **contestants**: Stores contestant details (`contestant_id`, `name`, `coach_id`).  \n   - **coaches**: Holds coach information (`coach_id`, `coach_name`).  \n   - **championship_results**: Tracks outcomes (`contestant_id`, `championship_id`, `won`).  \n   - Fields enable joins and filtering (e.g., find Jameson’s contestants → check their win status). \n\n**Note**: The hypothetical scenario (\"Imagine if...\") implies counterfactual analysis but relies purely on existing data relationships for probability computation."
