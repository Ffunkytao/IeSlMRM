I will give you a user's natural language question, please answer me in Json format and The key value of your json should be qualified as entities, relations, intent, reasoning_type, numerical_values, units, required_tables, and required_fields. this is example:\n{\n  \"entities\": [\"air conditioner model AC-1234\", \"indoor temperature 30°C\", \"target temperature 25°C\"],\n  \"relations\": [\"model_to_specs (AC-1234 → technical specifications)\", \"temperature_difference (ΔT=5°C)\"],\n  \"intent\": \"calculate_energy_required_for_cooling\",\n  \"reasoning_type\": \"physical knowledge reasoning\",\n  \"numerical_values\": [30, 25],\n  \"units\": {\n    \"temperature\": \"°C (Celsius)\",\n    \"energy\": \"kWh (implied by database schema)\",\n    \"conversion\": \"ΔT = 5°C (temperature differential)\"\n  },\n  \"required_tables\": [\"air_conditioner_info\", \"energy_consumption\"],\n  \"required_fields\": [\n    \"air_conditioner_info.model\", \n    \"air_conditioner_info.cooling_capacity_btu\",\n    \"air_conditioner_info.energy_efficiency_ratio\",\n    \"energy_consumption.power_consumption_watts\",\n    \"energy_consumption.energy_consumption_kwh\"\n  ]\n}\nThe question of user is as follows:\nIdentify mouse models that violate the EN 60950 safety standard (weight >150g when cable length <1m) and calculate their user fatigue factor (scrolls per minute × weight²/cable length).\n",
