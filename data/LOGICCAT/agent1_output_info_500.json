Other fields (`power_consumption_watts`, `test_type`) directly align with schema columns.  \n\n**Note on Implicit Duration Field:**  \nThe query mentions \"test duration (hours)\", but the `performance_tests` table lacks a direct duration column. This implies either:  \n- A derived value (e.g., timed test metadata not listed in schema), or  \n- Contextual interpretation where test duration must be inferred.  \nThe solution prioritizes query intent while noting this schema limitation."
