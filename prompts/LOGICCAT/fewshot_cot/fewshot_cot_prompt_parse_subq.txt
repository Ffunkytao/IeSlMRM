### Instruction:
Compute the energy required for air conditioner model AC-1234 in cooling mode to lower the indoor temperature from 30°C to 25°C.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: How to join the air_conditioner_info and usage_records tables by ac_id?  
Subanswer: We need to join these tables on ac_id to obtain model specifications and usage data. The answer is: air_conditioner_info JOIN usage_records ON air_conditioner_info.ac_id = usage_records.ac_id.  
Subquestion: How to filter records for model 'AC-1234', mode 'cooling', indoor_temperature_celsius = 30, and temperature_setting_celsius = 25?  
Subanswer: Use a WHERE clause with model = 'AC-1234' AND mode = 'cooling' AND indoor_temperature_celsius = 30 AND temperature_setting_celsius = 25. The answer is: model = 'AC-1234' AND mode = 'cooling' AND indoor_temperature_celsius = 30 AND temperature_setting_celsius = 25.  
Subquestion: How to calculate energy per unit time using the formula cooling_capacity_btu * usage_duration_hours / energy_efficiency_ratio?  
Subanswer: Apply the formula cooling_capacity_btu * usage_duration_hours / energy_efficiency_ratio. The answer is: cooling_capacity_btu * usage_duration_hours / energy_efficiency_ratio.  
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Compute the energy required for air conditioner model AC-1234 in cooling mode to lower the indoor temperature from 30°C to 25°C.  
Subanswer: The answer is:  
SELECT (cooling_capacity_btu * usage_duration_hours / energy_efficiency_ratio) AS required_energy_btu  
FROM air_conditioner_info  
JOIN usage_records ON air_conditioner_info.ac_id = usage_records.ac_id  
WHERE air_conditioner_info.model = 'AC-1234'  
  AND usage_records.mode = 'cooling'  
  AND usage_records.indoor_temperature_celsius = 30  
  AND usage_records.temperature_setting_celsius = 25;

### Instruction:
Calculate the total energy consumption of an air conditioner over one year, assuming it runs 8 hours per day at an average power consumption of 1500 watts.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: How to compute the base annual energy consumption?  
Subanswer: Multiply daily usage hours (8) by average power (1500 watts) and days per year (365). The answer is: 1500 * 8 * 365.  
Subquestion: How to convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours?  
Subanswer: Divide the result by 1000. The answer is: (1500 * 8 * 365) / 1000.  
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Calculate the total energy consumption over one year given 8 hours per day at 1500 watts.  
Subanswer: The answer is:  
SELECT (1500 * 8 * 365 / 1000) AS total_energy_consumption_kwh;

### Instruction:
Determine whether the energy efficiency ratio of air conditioner AC-5678 decreases under high temperature and humidity conditions.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: How to retrieve the original energy efficiency ratio for AC-5678?  
Subanswer: Query energy_efficiency_ratio from the air_conditioner_info table where ac_id = 'AC-5678'. The answer is: SELECT energy_efficiency_ratio FROM air_conditioner_info WHERE ac_id = 'AC-5678'.  
Subquestion: How to adjust the ratio for a 10% reduction?  
Subanswer: Multiply the original ratio by (1 - 0.1). The answer is: energy_efficiency_ratio * (1 - 0.1).  
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Determine if the energy efficiency ratio decreases for AC-5678 under high temperature and humidity.  
Subanswer: The answer is:  
SELECT energy_efficiency_ratio * (1 - 0.1) AS energy_efficiency_ratio_high_humidity  
FROM air_conditioner_info  
WHERE ac_id = 'AC-5678';

### Instruction:
Assuming an air conditioner has a cooling capacity of 100000 BTU and an energy efficiency ratio of 20, calculate its energy consumption when operating continuously for 100 hours in an extreme high-temperature environment (50°C), applying a compensation factor of 1.5.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: How to calculate the base energy consumption?  
Subanswer: Multiply cooling capacity (100000 BTU) by runtime (100 hours) divided by energy efficiency ratio (20). The answer is: 100000 * 100 / 20.  
Subquestion: What compensation factor applies for extreme high temperatures?  
Subanswer: Use a factor of 1.5. The answer is: * 1.5.  
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: Calculate energy consumption for 100 hours at 50°C with compensation.  
Subanswer: The answer is:  
SELECT (100000 * 100 / 20 * 1.5) AS extreme_energy_consumption_kwh;
