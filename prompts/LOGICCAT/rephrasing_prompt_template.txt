Original Question: Compute the energy required for air conditioner model AC-1234 in cooling mode to lower the indoor temperature from 30°C to 25°C.
Rephrased Question: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.  Condition 1: The air conditioner model is “AC-1234”.  Condition 2: The operating mode is “cooling”.  Condition 3: The indoor temperature is initially 30°C.  Condition 4: The target temperature is set to 25°C.  
Question: Compute the energy required to lower the indoor temperature from 30°C to 25°C for model AC-1234 in cooling mode.

Original Question: Calculate the total energy consumption of an air conditioner over one year, assuming it runs 8 hours per day at an average power consumption of 1500 watts.
Rephrased Question: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.  
Condition 1: The air conditioner runs 8 hours per day.  Condition 2: The average power consumption is 1500 watts.  Condition 3: It operates every day for 365 days in a year.  
Question: Calculate the total energy consumption over one year in kilowatt-hours.

Original Question: Determine whether the energy efficiency ratio of air conditioner AC-5678 decreases under high temperature and humidity conditions.
Rephrased Question: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.  Condition 1: The air conditioner ID is “AC-5678”.  Condition 2: High temperature and humidity reduce its energy efficiency ratio by 10%.  Question: Determine the adjusted energy efficiency ratio under these conditions.

Original Question: Assuming an air conditioner has a cooling capacity of 100000 BTU and an energy efficiency ratio of 20, calculate its energy consumption when operating continuously for 100 hours in an extreme high-temperature environment (50°C), applying a compensation factor of 1.5.
Rephrased Question: Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.  Condition 1: The cooling capacity is 100000 BTU.  Condition 2: The energy efficiency ratio is 20.  
Condition 3: It runs continuously for 100 hours.  Condition 4: A compensation factor of 1.5 applies in an extreme 50°C environment.  Question: Calculate the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours under these conditions.
